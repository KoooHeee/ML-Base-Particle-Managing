# Identifying Particle Management Points in Etch Process Based on The Tree-Based Models
Using a tree-based machine learning algorithm, we predict the level of particle contamination coming from Etch equipment. Based on the feature importance of this machine learning, we want to identify the recipe Steps and Sensors that contribute the most to particle generation to find new equipment management points.

## Dataset
We chose Etch process equipment among various semiconductor production equipment and used ICP Etch chamber.
Due to security issues, disclosure of the entire dataset and detailed Fault Detection and Classification (FDC) items, sensors, and steps is limited.

## Tree-based ML
We used Random forest, Extra trees classifier, and XGBoost as machine learning models to check feature importance.
